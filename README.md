# Welcome to the Security Report Dashboard

This project was created to display event system data within a Dashboard. In this project the user can checkout the data from theirs systems, and the data was created pretending it was a security camera system being invaded.

But first you need to follow the steps below:

## Clone repository

Clone the repository by running the following command:

```sh
# With SSH.
git@github.com:gusmagnago/dashboard.git

# Or with HTTPS.
https://github.com/gusmagnago/dashboard.git
```

### Install dependencies

Once you've cloned the repository install the required dependencies:

```sh
npm install 
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Thank you
